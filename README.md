NLP project - word cloud analysis of IMF policies

In this project, three International Monetary Fund's Letter of Intents have been analysed through word clouds. The frequency of keywords changes, illustrating evolving concerns and potential shifts in policy orientations. 

Project steps:

- Extract Letter of Intents from the IMF's website (webscraping of html documents)
- Clean the html documents (remove special characters, tags, punctuation, numbers, etc.)
- Use NLP techniques to build the corpus (tokenization, lemmatization)
- Create customized word clouds highlighting specific keywords
